<h3 align='center'> Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome to Gymness, I've been working on developing this site to create programs for every type of person, designed with specific goals in mind, both for gym and fitness.

Building muscle is the natural result of an adaptive response that ONLY takes place when your body is being SIGNALED to adapt. Without the proper muscular adaptation signals, your body will actually AVOID building muscle and losing weight. Our online training programs are phased into mini-cycles to avoid hitting plateaus that lead to frustration and burnout.</p>
